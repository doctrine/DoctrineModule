 * When this strategy is used for Collections, if the new collection does not contain elements that are present in
 * the original collection, then this strategy remove elements from the original collection. For instance, if the
 * collection initially contains elements A and B, and that the new collection contains elements B and C, then the
 * final collection will contain elements B and C (while element A will be asked to be removed).
 * This strategy is by reference, this means it won't use public API to add/remove elements to the collection
