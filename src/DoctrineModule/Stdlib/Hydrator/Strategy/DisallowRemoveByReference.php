/**
 * When this strategy is used for Collections, if the new collection does not contain elements that are present in
 * the original collection, then this strategy will not remove those elements. At most, it will add new elements. For
 * instance, if the collection initially contains elements A and B, and that the new collection contains elements B
 * and C, then the final collection will contain elements A, B and C.
 * This strategy is by reference, this means it won't use the public API to remove elements
